# The Pomodojack Application

### Contributors: Peter Tan, Sandra Martinez, Magdalene James, Nick Gluch

## The Why?

There are a lot of different task applications out there right now, but none of them has the Pomodoro Technique integrated within the application architechture. This application aims to create a tool to allow users to persistently store their tasks in a fun and visually relaxing way while applying the Pomodoro method to their general workflow. For more information on the Pomodoro Technique, [Click Here](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).

## The How?

We will be utilizing the following technologies in order to achieve the functionalities that our application aims to achieve:

* _MySQL_ for back end server
* _NodeJS_ for _Express.js_ usage and pathing as well as backend routing
* _Handlebars_ for website templating engine
* _Materialize_ for CSS and Javascript library

### So what is the workflow like?

* _At this point of the development, the full functionality of the application has not been achieved. However, we will attempt to show some functionality that we were able to achieve in the two-week development period that we had available for this project._

* _For the purpose of showing our available functionality, we have two versions of the working functionality shown below:

    The Mobile functions before back-end interference:

    The previous Desktop experience, workflow and bugs:

* _Disclaimer: the latest commit to this project caused an issue where the backend requests intercept each other thus causing different bugs, which will be shown below:_

    Current version bugs and workflow:

## Possible Future Feature Implementations:

- [ ] _The Pomodoro Timer_: The core timer feature for the Pomodoro Technique, should be able to move task cards forward following the Pomodoro workflow

- [ ] _Better and Smoother animation_: The animations need to be smoother and more responsive

- [ ] _Getting rid of back-end request interference_: The back-end interference needs to be fixed so that the cards can be responsively moved and removed.

- [ ] _Better Responsiveness of the Application_: Application front-end design needs to be more responsive and work better on a mobile platform, since the application design started out based on Mobile First Design.
